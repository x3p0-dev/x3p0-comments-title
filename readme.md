# X3P0 Comments Title

X3P0 Comments Title outputs the Comments Query Loop title (e.g., "X replies to {post title}"), which is currently not included alongside the Comments Query Loop block in WordPress/Gutenberg.

Comments Query Loop replaces the previous Post Comments block in WordPress 6.0.  However, as of this time, it seems that it will not have feature parity and is missing the title/heading.  See [related Gutenberg ticket](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40264).
